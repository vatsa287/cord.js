/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 * @module NetworkScore
 *
 * Network Scoring System Module.
 *
 * Overview:
 * This module offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities to interact with a blockchain-based rating system.
 * It is part of the Cord Network ecosystem and is designed to facilitate various operations related to ratings,
 * such as creation, revocation, and revision of rating entries, as well as fetching and aggregating rating data
 * from the blockchain. The module integrates with the Cord Network's blockchain API and types, providing an interface
 * for rating-related transactions and data handling on the blockchain.
 *
 * Key Functionalities:
 * - Creating and dispatching new rating entries to the blockchain.
 * - Revoking existing ratings, allowing for the removal of obsolete or incorrect ratings.
 * - Revising ratings to update or correct their details.
 * - Fetching detailed rating entries and aggregated score data from the blockchain.
 * - Validating rating contents and signatures to ensure data integrity and authenticity.
 * - Encoding and decoding rating values and other data for blockchain compatibility.
 * - Generating unique URIs and message IDs for rating entries for identification and tracking.
 * - Handling digital signatures for secure transactions.
 *
 * Usage:
 * This module is primarily used by Rating Authors or Ledger/API Providers within the Cord Network ecosystem.
 * It enables these entities to manage rating data effectively, ensuring that the ratings are accurately represented
 * and securely stored on the blockchain. The module's functions are designed to be used in a variety of scenarios,
 * from creating new ratings and modifying existing ones to retrieving comprehensive rating information for analysis
 * and presentation purposes.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * The module comprises several internal functions that handle the various aspects of rating data management,
 * including validating content, encoding and decoding values, managing digital signatures, and interacting
 * with the Cord Network blockchain API. These functions are designed to work together seamlessly, providing
 * a robust and efficient toolset for rating management on the blockchain.
 *
 * The module's functionality is exposed through a set of exportable functions, which can be integrated into
 * broader applications within the Cord Network ecosystem or other blockchain-based systems that require
 * sophisticated rating management capabilities.
