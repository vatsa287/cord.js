       * 
       * This function facilitates the amendment of a previously submitted
       * rating. It creates a debit entry referencing the original rating
       * entry. This function is typically used to correct or revoke a
       * rating.
       * 
       * # Arguments
       * * `origin` - The origin of the call, usually a signed user.
       * * `entry_identifier` - The identifier of the rating entry to be amended.
       * * `message_id` - A new message identifier for the amendment.
       * * `digest` - A hash representing the amendment, used for identification and integrity
       * purposes.
       * * `authorization` - An identifier for authorization, validating the origin's permission
       * to amend the rating.
       * 
       * # Errors
       * Returns `Error::<T>::RatingIdentifierNotFound` if the original
       * rating entry is not found.
       * Returns `Error::<T>::UnauthorizedOperation` if the origin does not
       * have the authority to amend the rating.
       * Returns `Error::<T>::MessageIdAlreadyExists` if the new message
       * identifier is already in use.
       * Returns `Error::<T>::InvalidIdentifierLength` if the generated
       * identifier for the amendment is of invalid length.
       * Returns `Error::<T>::RatingIdentifierAlreadyAdded` if the amendment
       * identifier is already in use.
       * 
       * # Events
       * Emits `RatingEntryRevoked` when a rating entry is successfully

      /**
       * Propose and approve a spend of treasury funds.
       * 
       * ## Dispatch Origin
       * 
       * Must be [`Config::SpendOrigin`] with the `Success` value being at least
       * `amount` of `asset_kind` in the native asset. The amount of `asset_kind` is converted
       * for assertion using the [`Config::BalanceConverter`].
       * 
       * ## Details
       * 
       * Create an approved spend for transferring a specific `amount` of `asset_kind` to a
       * designated beneficiary. The spend must be claimed using the `payout` dispatchable within
       * the [`Config::PayoutPeriod`].
       * 
       * ### Parameters
       * - `asset_kind`: An indicator of the specific asset class to be spent.
       * - `amount`: The amount to be transferred from the treasury to the `beneficiary`.
       * - `beneficiary`: The beneficiary of the spend.
       * - `valid_from`: The block number from which the spend can be claimed. It can refer to
       * the past if the resulting spend has not yet expired according to the
       * [`Config::PayoutPeriod`]. If `None`, the spend can be claimed immediately after
       * approval.
       * 
       * ## Events
       * 
       * Emits [`Event::AssetSpendApproved`] if successful.
